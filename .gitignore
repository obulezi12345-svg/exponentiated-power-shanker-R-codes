# Plots and other generated output files
# This is crucial for your project, as you're generating PDFs and CSVs
# that are *outputs* of your code, not source code themselves.
# If you want to keep them in the repo, remove these lines or make them more specific.
# Generally, anything that can be recreated by running your scripts should be ignored.
